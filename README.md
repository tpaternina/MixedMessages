# MixedMessages (Codecademy project)

MixedMessages is a node.js script that prints a randomized message to the console every time it runs. Baed on inspirational quotes vocabulary, it can piece together either a very inspirational sentence, or a very non-sensical and whacky piece of wisdom.

* Node v10.19.0
* Git v2.25.1

# Installation

Clone the repository with git:

```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/tpaternina/MixedMessages.git
